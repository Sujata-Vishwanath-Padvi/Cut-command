For many years a data structures course has been taught in computer science programs. Often it is regarded as a central course of the curriculum. It is fascinating and instructive to trace the history of how the subject matter for this course has changed. Back in the middle1960's the course was not entitled Data Structures but perhaps List Processing Languages. The major subjects were systems such as SLIP (by J. Weizenbaum), IPL-V (by A. Newell, C. Shaw, and H. Simon), LISP 1.5 (by J. McCarthy) and SNOBOL (by D. Farber, R. Griswold, and I. Polonsky). Then, in 1968, volume I of the Art of Computer Programming by D. Knuth appeared. His thesis was that list processing was not a magical thing that would only be accomplished within a specially designed system. Instead, he argued that the same techniques could be carried out in almost any language and he shifted the emphasis to efficient algorithm design. SLIP and IPL-V faded from the scene, while LISP and SNOBOL moved to the programming languages course. The new strategy was to explicitly construct a representation (such aslinked lists) within a set of consecutive storage locations and to describe the algorithms by using English plus assembly language.
